# Wim Hof Breathing Helper
## Description
Wim Hof Breathing Helper is a program designed to automate a few key components to a Wim Hof breathing session such as:

- Having Wim guide your breathing via mp3 files
- Playing a song during the breath hold
- Recording the hold times in a log file

## Setup
You may setup a venv

`python -m venv ./venv`

`pip install -r requirements.txt`

Then add songs into the song1, song2, and song3 folders. If you want to have more iterations to your Wim Hof experience, just make more folders!

## Usage
`python wim-hof.py`

Then enter the number of iterations you want to go for. 3 is typical

`3`

`enter`
